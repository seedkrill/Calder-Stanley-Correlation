# Calder Trophy and Its Relation To Stanley Cup Wins

I've been following a few NHL teams for a couple of years and I thought it would be an interesting project to see if there's a relationship between having the best rookies (Calder trophy) and winning the most championships (Stanley Cup). This is my first time scraping from a site, so it was a fun new project.  This project could be taken further to predict the current winners based on supervised random forest model, but aquiring stats for that project would be a whole other can of worms. Also, a preface that I don't mean to say that the Calder winners will always win the Cup the same year, but rather a team that wins more Calders is probably one that has better rosters; better built teams win Cups!

So for now, we ask:
Is there a significant statistical relationship between Calder winners in a team and Cups won by that team?
